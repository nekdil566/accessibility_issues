,AllykatTX,LYSN allows unchecked bullying & harassment,"When I originally joined the LYSN app I expected to have a good time interacting with my fav kpop group, EXO. LYSN CLAIMS that bullying and harassment of artists will not be tolerated on their app, but they are not enforcing their own policies. In the last few months since Kim Jongdae announced his engagement, antis have relentlessly spammed EXOâ€™s community board petitioning for him to leave the group. These toxic people have left violent threats for him and his family members. Yet, LYSN has allowed these people who spew their toxic words on the board to remain for months now. Star chatting with another EXO member, Kai, was recently announced and a person who has been repeatedly posting toxic posts aimed at Chen is now boasting on Twitter that theyâ€™ve been approved to be one of the people chatting with Kai. This is absolutely ridiculous. LYSN should be BANNING all of the people who are harassing artists on the app. The majority of those posting toxic content are â€˜ACEâ€™ members who have paid for extra content which means yâ€™all know their information.",1,when i originally joined the lysn app i expected to have a good time interacting with my fav kpop group exo lysn claim that bullying and harassment of artist will not be tolerated on their app but they are not enforcing their own policy in the last few month since kim jongdae announced his engagement anti have relentlessly spammed exo s community board petitioning for him to leave the group these toxic people have left violent threat for him and his family member yet lysn ha allowed these people who spew their toxic word on the board to remain for month now star chatting with another exo member kai wa recently announced and a person who ha been repeatedly posting toxic post aimed at chen is now boasting on twitter that they ve been approved to be one of the people chatting with kai this is absolutely ridiculous lysn should be banning all of the people who are harassing artist on the app the majority of those posting toxic content are ace member who have paid for extra content which mean y all know their information,Yes,Navigation and Interaction Problems (NAV)
,starry_sara,Filled with toxic and abusive comments,"Even though the companyâ€™s policy states they will not tolerate offensive comments or bullyingâ€” This app is FILLED with harassment of artists, along with toxic and abusive comments. More specifically, harassment targeting EXOâ€™s Chen. In January of this year, he announced heâ€™s getting married to his girlfriend, and theyâ€™re having a baby. Most of the EXO-Ls were happy to hear the news! But, the few fans that were not happy started harassing Chen through the Lysn app. Commenting the most disrespectful things: Like how Chen should leave EXO because heâ€™s getting married, how they wonâ€™t support EXO as long as Chenâ€™s in the group, or how that he disrespected the other members of EXO and the EXO-L by getting married (um... WHAT...?), etc.. 
 And, despite all this hate, Lysn has done NOTHING to remove those comments or those hateful people from the app... 
 So, me and the rest of the (real) fans are downright confused by this, and disappointed beyond words... Please, listen. Seriously, FIX YOUR APP AND POLICIES.",1,even though the company s policy state they will not tolerate offensive comment or bullying this app is filled with harassment of artist along with toxic and abusive comment more specifically harassment targeting exo s chen in january of this year he announced he s getting married to his girlfriend and they re having a baby most of the exols were happy to hear the news but the few fan that were not happy started harassing chen through the lysn app commenting the most disrespectful thing like how chen should leave exo because he s getting married how they won t support exo a long a chen s in the group or how that he disrespected the other member of exo and the exol by getting married um what etc and despite all this hate lysn ha done nothing to remove those comment or those hateful people from the app so me and the rest of the real fan are downright confused by this and disappointed beyond word please listen seriously fix your app and policy,Yes,Navigation and Interaction Problems (NAV)

,@junmyeonsoup,"Despicable, toxic community for artist and fans","I expected this app to be a good time for me to share with my favorite group EXO and the exols who love them. Instead, it has been used to not only demean the actual EXO members, Kim Jongdae specifically, and to ostracize those in the fandom who are not ace members (which is the majority, since we are international fans and have no need for the ace membership perks). The fact that this app has been a breeding ground for the toxic fans to discuss and carry out their harassment strategies on Kim Jongdae of EXO, even so far as defaming him in his hometown, and those in charge of the app have done nothing to assuage this behavior proves to me this app needs to be taken down.

,Happy~Starfish,"Cute, but certain things REALLY ruin it.","It is a very cute, fun app. I downloaded it when it came out as an EXO-L and haven't used it that much until recently. There are many features and nice things about it, like sharing your love for your favorite artist with other fans, and a translate button to communicate with and understand fans who speak different languages. I am liking it, but there are a couple things about it that really bother me and make what could be a good experience not so great.
 
 -One thing that bothers me is whenever I am making a new post, I cannot see what I am typing. The space between ""Please Enter Title"" and the keyboard is extremely little, making it so that I can barely see what I am saying, and every time I type that text moves up and down making it even more difficult.
 
 -Another thing I dislike is that most if not all the time get notifications about 20-30 minutes late. The point of notifications is to know what is happening and to keep up to date, when you get them late that defeats the purpose.
 
 -The thing that bothers me the most however is the paid fan-club known as ACE. Not only you have to pay money (about $30 initially then about $13 to renew) to access content and chat with the artist, I have also noticed that some fans use this as a superiority complex to bully other fans who they disagree with who are not ACE. This leads into my next point that,
 
 -Because of the division between ACE and basic, it hasn't felt like a very safe space for everyone. While there are still some nice posts, it feels divided and not as positive and united as it could be because of the lack of monitoring and action taken against the people bullying other fans and the artist. Recently EXO member Chen announced that he is getting married and having a child and on the app, the same ACE fans are repeatedly asking him to leave the group and making other malicious posts, breaking the rules of the community guidelines, yet no action is taken against them.
 
 -To put it short, I have not been enjoying this app as much as I could be because of the bug when typing new posts, late notifications, paying for content, and the lack of action taken against rude ACE fans who bully the artist and fans who are basic.",1,it is a very cute fun app i downloaded it when it came out a an exol and havent used it that much until recently there are many feature and nice thing about it like sharing your love for your favorite artist with other fan and a translate button to communicate with and understand fan who speak different language i am liking it but there are a couple thing about it that really bother me and make what could be a good experience not so great one thing that bother me is whenever i am making a new post i cannot see what i am typing the space between please enter title and the keyboard is extremely little making it so that i can barely see what i am saying and every time i type that text move up and down making it even more difficult another thing i dislike is that most if not all the time get notification about minute late the point of notification is to know what is happening and to keep up to date when you get them late that defeat the purpose the thing that bother me the most however is the paid fanclub known a ace not only you have to pay money about initially then about to renew to access content and chat with the artist i have also noticed that some fan use this a a superiority complex to bully other fan who they disagree with who are not ace this lead into my next point that because of the division between ace and basic it hasnt felt like a very safe space for everyone while there are still some nice post it feel divided and not a positive and united a it could be because of the lack of monitoring and action taken against the people bullying other fan and the artist recently exo member chen announced that he is getting married and having a child and on the app the same ace fan are repeatedly asking him to leave the group and making other malicious post breaking the rule of the community guideline yet no action is taken against them to put it short i have not been enjoying this app a much a i could be because of the bug when typing new post late notification paying for content and the lack of action taken against rude ace fan who bully the artist and fan who are basic,Yes,UI Accessibility Issues (UI)

,V.143,Only accepts Chinese phone number,"This app only accepts a Chinese phone number. I just wanted to test this app to see why itâ€™s so popular, and potentially use it more once Iâ€™m better at reading and speaking Chinese, but without a Chinese phone number it wonâ€™t even let me create an account. Even if Iâ€™ve heard they accept all international numbers, the only valid options are Chinese area codes. Do not get this app unless you are actually in china. If you want alternatives try Snapchat or messengers like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, or for Korea, try Naver apps like their Line messenger, which are very popular here in the US and in Korea. Even international Chinese canâ€™t even use this app if they switched to a US number after moving here, and even though this isnâ€™t my case, I can strongly empathize with frustrated people who want to continue using their favorite messaging app but canâ€™t after moving. Please fix these basic things and donâ€™t lock out your users because of location; itâ€™s really frustrating and ultimately probably looses you many regular users a year. Also, if you want to release a Chinese app on the American App Store, a lot of us would appreciate an English toggle switch so we can actually navigate if we have friends in China and want to communicate with them through this app. Even if Iâ€™m going to be studying Chinese in college itâ€™ll take me awhile to get to the level where I can read some of the prompts they put and the ad for the app. Fix these and it will make many potential and current users happy.

,Greeneyesgaia,Not that bad,"Ok so Iâ€™m giving this part of talking to my husband or just sending him money a 3star and here is whyâ€¦
 
  Connect Network GTL app is not all that bad. I have like 2 or 3 complaints and thatâ€™s a maybe. First complaint is that I have had to create numerous accounts and here is why and also complaint number 2, after one of my cards gets declined the whole account stops working for me and then I canâ€™t give my husband or his friends money on their accounts. Finally complaint number 3 is that you canâ€™t delete you account so now you are stuck with all these accounts. 
 
  My only problem with the GTL GettingOut app for messaging and pictures is that most pictures get denied on there but you can send in a regular photo and it gets approved and that it takes to long sometimes to approve the pictures. 
 
  And my only issue or complaint with the GO Visits GTL app is the constant Verification Required every time I log back into my account.
 
  Other then those problems, this app and the 2 other apps are not that bad. Maybe just give everyone there own tablet, donâ€™t restrict access, and let video chats happen even when not docked or in day room. Thatâ€™s all I have for now!
 
  Oh yeah and stop cutting people off anywhere between 10-14 or 15-19 minutes when we are given 15 or 20 minutes depending on the type of call our loved ones make.

,BJ Flowers,"Great app, but few suggestions","I have enjoyed using this app in order to stay connected with my loved one especially during this time of uncertainty with the pandemic and in person visits had been removed. Thankfully I have finally been able to see him a few times in person now and that has been GREAT. A couple things that would be nice on the app is the option to delete old messages, especially all of the notifications regarding the message credits that were sent. Itâ€™s nice to get those so we know he got it, but it would be great for me to be able to delete those messages so that they arenâ€™t clogging up my inbox and sent box. Plus there are old messages that either I have sent or he has sent that I donâ€™t necessarily need or want to keep, so it would be nice to be able to delete those as well. I know the delete option is available in the drafts folder, so again, it would be great if that could be added to the in and sent box as well. The only other thing is that I have noticed at times there are long delays of message approvals, more so on the messages he sends to me, he seems to get my message pretty quickly. Other than those issues, I think the app is a great tool to be able to stay connected and I appreciate the ability to be able to message him when we canâ€™t talk any time we want. Oh, also, not sure if the correctional office has control over this, but it would be GREAT if he could get the phone app on his tablet so that maybe he could make calls outside of his dayroom times.

 Don't miss out on the field entries that put the keyboard over the submit button. You get to press ""return"" only to find the submit button or the next field area (it's not a box, because we're not doing that this time).

I havenâ€™t received any crash reports since the update (yet), and itâ€™s improved. Thatâ€™s all I can say for now. 
 
 Previous review: Seriously, Woodforest- what a pitiful standard of products you offer your customers that keep your bank alive. Your app constantly, constantly crashes. Every single time I log in- the app crashes and has to reboot and I have to send a crash report all before I can even login again just to check my balance. What should be a 1min task, turns out to be 5-7min- and this is just to get into the app. Such a lag in every aspect. Not, by any means, a streamlined process nor is it user friendly or up to date with banking standards mobile compatibilities. Woodforest must be going bankrupt if they canâ€™t even afford a better app for its customers. If thatâ€™s the case, many of us may want to consider pulling all your money out and going to a different bank before they drop out. Other banks that have plenty of money coming in, have a far more streamlined process for its customers when it comes to its app and mobile capabilities. Either Woodforest clearly doesnâ€™t care about providing good products to its customers or itâ€™s going bankrupt. 100% guarantee you.",4,updated seems woodforest updated the app honestly it s about time but i don t want to speak to soon i m adjusting my star to a star simply because they finally took action and that s how important a streamlined process is for user i haven t received any crash report since the update yet and it s improved that s all i can say for now previous review seriously woodforest what a pitiful standard of product you offer your customer that keep your bank alive your app constantly constantly crash every single time i log in the app crash and ha to reboot and i have to send a crash report all before i can even login again just to check my balance what should be a min task turn out to be min and this is just to get into the app such a lag in every aspect not by any mean a streamlined process nor is it user friendly or up to date with banking standard mobile compatibility woodforest must be going bankrupt if they can t even afford a better app for it customer if that s the case many of u may want to consider pulling all your money out and going to a different bank before they drop out other bank that have plenty of money coming in have a far more streamlined process for it customer when it come to it app and mobile capability either woodforest clearly doesn t care about providing good product to it customer or it s going bankrupt guarantee you,Yes,UI Accessibility Issues (UI)
,Rawlers30,"Good app, bad bug","This app is great. Iâ€™ve been using it for a while now.

Only for me to get a call to say there was an error and they didnâ€™t complete the process. I believe it was deliberate, but I would get into why I think it was. Just know, Nigeria is filled with very insecure people.

 Update:
 
 VH1â€™s response: This is VH1 App Support. We understand that ads are probably not the reason you come to the app. Our apps are ad supported and being ad supported means we can keep a lot of our content available to you free of charge. That said we are always experimenting with different advertisers and types of ads to create the best user experience. We would appreciate your feedback so we can best understand your experience on our app.
 
 My Reply:
 
 VH1 App Support,
 
 Thank you for your response to my review of your iOS and tvOS applications. I understand that advertising support is an important part of your business model in order to provide content free of charge. My issue is not with the applications being ad supported. My issue is that your applications frequently lock up and become unresponsive when entering or leaving the ads, and are generally very buggy. Often the AppleTV app requires me to sign in with my TV provider information every time I come back to watch content, and on numerous occasions has still not allowed content to play even though I have signed in with a valid TV provider credential. Further, the application frequently locks up when attempting to return to the VH1 content from the ads. At times your application will crash outright. At other times it will appear that an ad should be playing, but the VH1 content is playing anyway, despite the ad content countdown. So while your content typically seems to have far more adversing than other networks when it working properly, the fact that the ads stop the content from returning is what is most frustrating. I am running the latest versions of the operating systems on both my iPhone X and on my Apple TV 4 and the most updated VH1 App available. My frustration is that your applications are buggy, unresponsive, crash frequently, and lock up while showing ad content, not that they are ad supported. Based on the overall rating of your application I don't think I am the only one encountering difficulties.",1,this app is unusable there are so many ad you cannot watch a show but worse the app freeze up trying to switch back to the show from the ad so you can t actually watch it s so frustrating vh need to get their act together update vh s response this is vh app support we understand that ad are probably not the reason you come to the app our apps are ad supported and being ad supported mean we can keep a lot of our content available to you free of charge that said we are always experimenting with different advertiser and type of ad to create the best user experience we would appreciate your feedback so we can best understand your experience on our app my reply vh app support thank you for your response to my review of your io and tvos application i understand that advertising support is an important part of your business model in order to provide content free of charge my issue is not with the application being ad supported my issue is that your application frequently lock up and become unresponsive when entering or leaving the ad and are generally very buggy often the appletv app requires me to sign in with my tv provider information every time i come back to watch content and on numerous occasion ha still not allowed content to play even though i have signed in with a valid tv provider credential further the application frequently lock up when attempting to return to the vh content from the ad at time your application will crash outright at other time it will appear that an ad should be playing but the vh content is playing anyway despite the ad content countdown so while your content typically seems to have far more adversing than other network when it working properly the fact that the ad stop the content from returning is what is most frustrating i am running the latest version of the operating system on both my iphone x and on my apple tv and the most updated vh app available my frustration is that your application are buggy unresponsive crash frequently and lock up while showing ad content not that they are ad supported based on the overall rating of your application i dont think i am the only one encountering difficulty,Yes,UI Accessibility Issues (UI)

,PinkPanther130,Insight,"Hereâ€™s a bit of insight from someone that has been using the app for over 4 years now. 
 In the beginning the initial thought was â€˜wow this is great and second chance entries and keeping track of all my tickets for meâ€™ 
 About 2 years in the mentality evolved to â€˜hmmm the app has a lot of trouble scanning anything and every menu link seems to be broken. Not to mention Iâ€™ve not gotten many â€œrewardsâ€ from all the points Iâ€™ve racked up (over 180k). The contests seem like a bait and switch anyway maybe Iâ€™ll check into it.â€™ 
 And over the most recent couple years Iâ€™ve become confident saying that the â€œsecond chance drawingsâ€ and â€œcontestsâ€ are a joke. They are completely rigged and I challenge any of you out there to just open some of the past drawings winners list and look through a few of them. Itâ€™s not long before you spot repeated names. Moreover if curiosity hadnâ€™t gotten the best of me I wouldnâ€™t have gone a step further and researched some of these name and Verified just shy of a photo id. Even more interesting and worth getting some attention is that a couple specific findings linked winners of the â€œcontestsâ€ to managers and higher-ups of circle k stores, and a load of well off business owners/ceo/vp types just check for yourself. I can testify to the fact that myself and two other people close to me that are avid lottery players and used the second chance point collecting to the extreme, combined we were nearly at 750k points from tickets bought at all different locations across Arizona. Wanna guess what Iâ€™m gonna say nextâ€¦..yep , not a single second chance win EVER! 
 
 Most recently for my birthday I saved quite a bit of points up and put them all toward the KNIX Secret show drawing. I had over 1300 entries. What a load of garbage. 
 
 It would be nice to know HOW MANY ENTRIES TOTAL are in each â€œgiveawayâ€ not just your own entries. There should be a % of likely hood to win based on the continually increasing number of entries just like on the back of tickets -though who knows how well thatâ€™s actually audited for correctness. I mean this state couldnâ€™t even handle counting when it was on a more important issue like our votes.

Iâ€™m forced to use the â€œselfieâ€ camera when (attempting) check tickets. Itâ€™s impossible for my front camera to successfully scan any of the tickets as itâ€™s not equipped with auto focus.
 
 To check if a ticket is a winner,& have to stop by a retail location or enter it in then The 2nd chance area. If itâ€™s not accepted, that means I won! Unfortunately, I canâ€™t verify the amount. 
 
 The second chance area has a far better setup for me as Iâ€™m able to manually enter the ticketâ€™s relevant information and submit. I would love this option when checking to see if I won as well. Hopefully that makes sense :)
 
 (Side note: it would be super convenient to enter either multiple tickets from the same game, same pack and/or even the same type if possible. When I have a stack of tickets so much of the data entry is redundant and quite tedious. Any improvement would be appreciated. I donâ€™t see why Iâ€™m taken to the very beginning of the process after submitting.

 Update:
 
 VH1â€™s response: This is VH1 App Support. We understand that ads are probably not the reason you come to the app. Our apps are ad supported and being ad supported means we can keep a lot of our content available to you free of charge. That said we are always experimenting with different advertisers and types of ads to create the best user experience. We would appreciate your feedback so we can best understand your experience on our app.
 
 My Reply:
 
 VH1 App Support,
 
 Thank you for your response to my review of your iOS and tvOS applications. I understand that advertising support is an important part of your business model in order to provide content free of charge. My issue is not with the applications being ad supported. My issue is that your applications frequently lock up and become unresponsive when entering or leaving the ads, and are generally very buggy. Often the AppleTV app requires me to sign in with my TV provider information every time I come back to watch content, and on numerous occasions has still not allowed content to play even though I have signed in with a valid TV provider credential. Further, the application frequently locks up when attempting to return to the VH1 content from the ads. At times your application will crash outright. At other times it will appear that an ad should be playing, but the VH1 content is playing anyway, despite the ad content countdown. So while your content typically seems to have far more adversing than other networks when it working properly, the fact that the ads stop the content from returning is what is most frustrating. I am running the latest versions of the operating systems on both my iPhone X and on my Apple TV 4 and the most updated VH1 App available. My frustration is that your applications are buggy, unresponsive, crash frequently, and lock up while showing ad content, not that they are ad supported. Based on the overall rating of your application I don't think I am the only one encountering difficulties.",1,this app is unusable there are so many ad you cannot watch a show but worse the app freeze up trying to switch back to the show from the ad so you can t actually watch it s so frustrating vh need to get their act together update vh s response this is vh app support we understand that ad are probably not the reason you come to the app our apps are ad supported and being ad supported mean we can keep a lot of our content available to you free of charge that said we are always experimenting with different advertiser and type of ad to create the best user experience we would appreciate your feedback so we can best understand your experience on our app my reply vh app support thank you for your response to my review of your io and tvos application i understand that advertising support is an important part of your business model in order to provide content free of charge my issue is not with the application being ad supported my issue is that your application frequently lock up and become unresponsive when entering or leaving the ad and are generally very buggy often the appletv app requires me to sign in with my tv provider information every time i come back to watch content and on numerous occasion ha still not allowed content to play even though i have signed in with a valid tv provider credential further the application frequently lock up when attempting to return to the vh content from the ad at time your application will crash outright at other time it will appear that an ad should be playing but the vh content is playing anyway despite the ad content countdown so while your content typically seems to have far more adversing than other network when it working properly the fact that the ad stop the content from returning is what is most frustrating i am running the latest version of the operating system on both my iphone x and on my apple tv and the most updated vh app available my frustration is that your application are buggy unresponsive crash frequently and lock up while showing ad content not that they are ad supported based on the overall rating of your application i dont think i am the only one encountering difficulty,Yes,UI Accessibility Issues (UI)

 Most apps will make shows available within hours of the show being aired. 
 Or at least the next day.

,PinkPanther130,Insight,"Hereâ€™s a bit of insight from someone that has been using the app for over 4 years now. 
 In the beginning the initial thought was â€˜wow this is great and second chance entries and keeping track of all my tickets for meâ€™ 
 About 2 years in the mentality evolved to â€˜hmmm the app has a lot of trouble scanning anything and every menu link seems to be broken. Not to mention Iâ€™ve not gotten many â€œrewardsâ€ from all the points Iâ€™ve racked up (over 180k). The contests seem like a bait and switch anyway maybe Iâ€™ll check into it.â€™ 
 And over the most recent couple years Iâ€™ve become confident saying that the â€œsecond chance drawingsâ€ and â€œcontestsâ€ are a joke. They are completely rigged and I challenge any of you out there to just open some of the past drawings winners list and look through a few of them. Itâ€™s not long before you spot repeated names. Moreover if curiosity hadnâ€™t gotten the best of me I wouldnâ€™t have gone a step further and researched some of these name and Verified just shy of a photo id. Even more interesting and worth getting some attention is that a couple specific findings linked winners of the â€œcontestsâ€ to managers and higher-ups of circle k stores, and a load of well off business owners/ceo/vp types just check for yourself. I can testify to the fact that myself and two other people close to me that are avid lottery players and used the second chance point collecting to the extreme, combined we were nearly at 750k points from tickets bought at all different locations across Arizona. Wanna guess what Iâ€™m gonna say nextâ€¦..yep , not a single second chance win EVER! 
 
 Most recently for my birthday I saved quite a bit of points up and put them all toward the KNIX Secret show drawing. I had over 1300 entries. What a load of garbage. 
 
 It would be nice to know HOW MANY ENTRIES TOTAL are in each â€œgiveawayâ€ not just your own entries. There should be a % of likely hood to win based on the continually increasing number of entries just like on the back of tickets -though who knows how well thatâ€™s actually audited for correctness. I mean this state couldnâ€™t even handle counting when it was on a more important issue like our votes. 
 
 If you have made it this far in my review i commend your commitment. And highly suggest if you do download the app to do so with extreme caution and awareness to the fact that winning is just a marketing option used by the lottery for these drawings. 
 Neither here nor there I truly wish luck and fortune to those of us trying to just one day catch a break.

,Yellow Scalloped Beauty,Update scanning and manual entry option for ticket checking (please!),"The main camera on my iPhone 6s is broken. Iâ€™m forced to use the â€œselfieâ€ camera when (attempting) check tickets. Itâ€™s impossible for my front camera to successfully scan any of the tickets as itâ€™s not equipped with auto focus.
 
 To check if a ticket is a winner,& have to stop by a retail location or enter it in then The 2nd chance area. If itâ€™s not accepted, that means I won! Unfortunately, I canâ€™t verify the amount. 
 
 The second chance area has a far better setup for me as Iâ€™m able to manually enter the ticketâ€™s relevant information and submit. I would love this option when checking to see if I won as well. Hopefully that makes sense :)
 
 (Side note: it would be super convenient to enter either multiple tickets from the same game, same pack and/or even the same type if possible. When I have a stack of tickets so much of the data entry is redundant and quite tedious. Any improvement would be appreciated. I donâ€™t see why Iâ€™m taken to the very beginning of the process after submitting.
